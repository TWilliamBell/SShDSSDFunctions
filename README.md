# SShDSSDFunctions

There are two files in this repository, Useful_Geomorph_Functions.R which includes functions meant for estimating SShD (sexual shape dimorphism) and SSD (sexual size dimorphism), and Default_Package_of_Functions.R which just includes functions I defined for myself and that I find helpful.

Can be used to reproduce analysis for meta-analysis of SSD/SShD relationship, coming soon!
